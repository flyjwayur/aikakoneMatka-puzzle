## Introduction
Back to the past \^o^/

It is a collaborative multiplayer puzzle game with inspiring Finnish architecture images.

## Development 
### Using 'boot'(boot run & boot build) 
It is built based on a play-cljs ClojureScript game library.

Do `boot run` to develop and `boot build` to compile a release version.

### Generating 'project.clj' 
Whenever any boot task is run(e.g. `boot run`) `project.clj` is generated automatically

so that IntelliJ will understand this as a leiningen project and Cursive can help our development.

### Running project & Browser editing 'Nightlight'
Go to 'localhost:3000' to see running project and,

Go to 'localhost:4000' to edit project on the browser with 'Nightlight'.

### Checking the code 
Run 'boot check' to find out if the code can be improved.
